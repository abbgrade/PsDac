# Readme

PsDac connects DacFx and PowerShell. It gives you PowerShell Cmdlets with the power of [Microsoft.SqlServer.DacFx](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SqlServer.DacFx). For example you can access the content of a Dacpac file to generate documentation, or Azure Data Factory pipelines. Or do PowerShell native deployments without [SqlPackage.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/sql/tools/sqlpackage/sqlpackage?view=sql-server-ver15).
